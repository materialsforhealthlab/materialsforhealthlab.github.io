		<p> <a> Emma Daniels </a> <br>
		CSCT PhD Student (2018-) <br>
		<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Emma graduated from the University of Nottingham in 2018 with a Masters degree in Chemistry. During her degree, Emma worked with Prof Neil Champness developing a novel [3]-rotaxane and investigating its use in catalysis and completed a computational project under the supervision of Prof Elena Besley, investigating the implantation of metal ions into carbon nanostructures using molecular dynamic simulations. Emma is currently in the second year of her integrated PhD on the CDT in Sustainable Chemical Technologies, co-supervised by <a href="https://www.buchardgroup.org/"> Dr Antoine Buchard </a> and <a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/steve-parker"> Prof Steve Parker </a>. Her research is looking at the synthesis and computational design of sugar-derived polymers for application in bio-sensing to detect disease. In her spare time Emma enjoys being part of the dance society and practising yoga. </p>

		C3Bio PhD Student (2019-) <br>
		<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Yasemin is a current PhD student working on "Multifunctional Devices for Rapid Point-of Diagnostics" co-supervised by <a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/pedro-estrela"> Dr Pedro Estrela </a> and <a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/despina-moschou"> Dr Despina Moschou </a>. This project is dedicated to the development of a novel multiplex platform biosensor device for the diagnosis of the onset of infection, with a specific focus on sepsis at the point-of-care to prevent the distribution of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Yasemin obtained a Chemistry (BSc) and a Chemical Research (MSc) from Queen Mary University of London with both degrees demonstrating a strong focus on biomaterials. The research projects concentrated on the synthesis of phosphate-based glasses for tissue engineering. </p>

		<p> <a> Joe Turner </a> <br>
		Abbott PhD Student (2019-) <br>
		<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Joe is a current PhD student working on the project titled: “Detect, Treat and Tell” (shortened) – developing polymeric responsive microneedle-based skin patches. This research project is EPSRC match-funded with Abbott and co-supervised by <a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/pedro-estrela"> Dr Pedro Estrela </a> and Dr Michael Thatcher (Abbott). Joe joined the University of Bath in 2019 after obtaining a master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering (MEng) from Swansea University. During this time Joe worked on graphene biosensors in the Centre for NanoHealth and on novel acid soluble collagen foams for regenerative medicine. Joe’s interests include 3D printing which he uses to fabricate microneedles. </p>
