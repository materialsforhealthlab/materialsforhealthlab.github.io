		<p> <a> Emma Daniels </a> <br>
		CSCT PhD Student (2018-) <br>
		<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Emma graduated from the University of Nottingham in 2018 with a Masters degree in Chemistry. During her degree, Emma worked with Prof Neil Champness developing a novel [3]-rotaxane and investigating its use in catalysis and completed a computational project under the supervision of Prof Elena Besley, investigating the implantation of metal ions into carbon nanostructures using molecular dynamic simulations. Emma is currently in the second year of her integrated PhD on the CDT in Sustainable Chemical Technologies, co-supervised by <a href="https://www.buchardgroup.org/"> Dr Antoine Buchard </a> and <a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/steve-parker"> Prof Steve Parker </a>. Her research is looking at the synthesis and computational design of sugar-derived polymers for application in bio-sensing to detect disease. In her spare time Emma enjoys being part of the dance society and practising yoga. </p>
