Our Materials for Health Lab, is developing advanced materials for transformative sustainable healthcare. 
Specifically, to develop materials that can detect and diagnose the presence of disease at point-of-care. 
Health and Well-being is the third goal of the [UN Sustainability Development Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg3), and our research is 
seeking to contribute to sustaining healthcare, democratising healthcare and tackling the ever-increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance.
