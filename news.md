* **Oct 2021:** We are very happy to welcome [Olivia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-faye-dickinson-34657b171) to the group. Olivia has recently started her PhD in the area of peptide fibre development towards textile sustainability through the joint Bath-Monash PhD programme. 

* **Aug 2021:** Congratulations to Emma and Yasemin, for their awesome work on molecularly imprinted polymers recently published in ACS Applied Bio Materials, check it out here... [Optimization of Cortisol-Selective Molecularly Imprinted Polymers Enabled by Molecular Dynamics Simulations](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsabm.1c00774)

* **Aug 2021:** Congratulations to Harindi for publishing her review paper [Molecular Diagnostics in the Era of COVID-19](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2021/AY/D1AY00947H). Great work!

* **Jul 2021:** Recent work on therapeutic graphene oxide fibres [just published](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7639/ac114c) in *J Phys Materials*, as part of the Special Issue Focus on Women's Perspectives in Materials Science: 2D Materials.

* **Jun 2021:** Happy International Women in Engineering Day! Sandhya and I feature on [CRUK Twitter](https://twitter.com/CRUKresearch/status/1407686912727556096) to talk about our CRUK Primer award and how we are utilising engineering to advance the early detection of ovarian cancer.

* **Apr 2021:** [Yasemin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasemin-mustafa-b12106150/?originalSubdomain=uk) and [Emma](https://www.csct.ac.uk/people/emma-daniels/) present at the [WESBath - University of Bath Student Women's Engineering Society](https://www.facebook.com/pg/wesbath/photos/?ref=page_internal) event inspiring the next generation of engineering PhD students! Capturing some important words and thoughts from Yasemin *"Tonight I will be participating at the WES function, both delivering and listening to all the cutting-edge technologies from self-healing concrete to biosensor development being developed from different areas within the Department of Engineering. A panel discussion will be held whereby we acknowledge the work being carried out by PhD students giving those that are considering studying at PhD level an insight into the discipline. It is hoped that this function will serve as an empowering platform for the underrepresented community of women in engineering".*

* **Apr 2021:** Welcome to the MfH Lab [Dr Antonios Keirouz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonykeirouz/)!
